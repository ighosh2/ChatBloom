INFO:root:Session ID: a3fd00f8-ed4f-4f4c-9f9a-ea86a1826e0d, AI Response: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit programming. Instead of being programmed with specific rules, machine learning systems learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

In essence, machine learning allows computers to recognize patterns, improve performance on tasks over time, and make informed decisions based on new data. There are several types of machine learning, including:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs) and learns to map inputs to the correct output.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on unlabeled data and tries to find patterns or groupings in the data without any specific guidance.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions within an environment.

Machine learning is widely used in various applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more.
